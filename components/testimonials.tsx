            I was also adamant the next man I&apos;d be with and commit to,
            would be the man I&apos;d spend the rest of my life with (just not
            married). I was very fussy and didn&apos;t expect to meet a man on
            Tinder. I decided to sign up anyways and just match away and see
            what happened.

            For all the single people out there, especially introverted ones
            like us: do not be afraid to travel outside of your comfort zone.
            That&apos;s where you&apos;ll make a genuine connection. Tinder
            brought us together and for that, I am forever grateful. ‚ù§

            My college roommate and I both would stay up on Tinder, not looking
            for anything serious (also not looking for hookups though, just
            entertainment). My now husband and I matched on Tinder.
